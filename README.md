I've been playing with this, and making some big improvements to it. One of the bugs in the older version was that 50% of the time, it worked every time. **Now it's working 100% of every time.**

The big new feature is a new mode for assigning MAC addresses to SSIDs. The old mode is "0" ("macMode = 0"), and it works as expected, and can be seen in this start-up message:
```
//// Atom Smasher's Beacon Spammer v1.3 ////

// MACs:                 SSIDs:
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:00     one
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:01     two
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:02     three
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:03     four
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:04     five
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:05     six
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:06     seven
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:07     eight
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:08     nine
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:09     ten
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:0a     eleven
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:0b     twelve
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:0c     thirteen
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:0d     fourteen
     7e:1c:b7:8d:80:0e     fifteen

// randomMacSeed:        SSIDs:                Started in:
     0x12345abc            15                    0.569s

[60.009] 148.98 packets/s,  99.3%
[120.000] 150.00 packets/s, 100.0%
[180.000] 150.00 packets/s, 100.0%
[240.000] 150.00 packets/s, 100.0%
[300.000] 150.00 packets/s, 100.0%
[...]
```

As expected, a random MAC is set, and SSIDs will sequentially increment the MAC address. As of v1.1, this works with a little over 23,000 SSID names, rolling over the 4th and 5th octets of the MAC address as needed; more SSID names made compilation fail. The new mode "1" ("macMode = 1") sets the MAC addresses "randomly", as can be seen in this start-up message:
```

     02:7e:32:0a:96:c0     three
     da:6f:e4:dc:c2:7e     four
     9e:8f:7f:08:33:d8     five

     e6:87:c9:21:fc:6e     twelve
     ea:8e:43:37:7e:03     thirteen
     56:71:fb:17:a5:e8     fourteen
     12:75:37:05:0d:e6     fifteen

// randomMacSeed:        SSIDs:                Started in:
     0x12345abc            15                    0.562s

[60.000] 149.00 packets/s,  99.3%
[120.000] 150.00 packets/s, 100.0%
[180.000] 150.00 packets/s, 100.0%
[240.000] 150.00 packets/s, 100.0%
[300.000] 150.00 packets/s, 100.0%
[...]
```

Note that the "randomMacSeed" is the same in both of those, which is why the first MAC address in the second start-up message resembles all of the MAC addresses in the first start-up message.

The "randomMacSeed" can be set randomly, giving different MAC addresses (per list of SSIDs names) every time it's re-started, or it can be set manually for consistency, or to "synchronise" two or more devices to have the same MAC addresses.

The code is also written to make it easy to manually set any parts of the MAC address, eg "set" the first three octets, or set the last four octets to "deadbeef", or whatever. The range of each octet's random assignment can also be set, and bitmasking can be used to exclude or set certain digits to certain values.

The start-up messages sent to the serial port seem useful, at least to me.

The biggest bug-fix over what was inherited from earlier versions was fixing the "I/G bit". Left to chance, 50% of the time it works every time. Now it works 100% of the time, every time. While I was fixing that, I coded to set the "U/L bit". The default setting leaves that set to "local" mode, but that's easy to change as desired, or leave it to random chance.

The throttle function prevents it from sending more than 10 beacons per second, per SSID, per channel. As can be seen in the start-up messages, 15 SSIDs, on one channel, and it's being throttled to 150 packets/second. In my testing, it tops out at about 930 packets/second, so at about 90-100 SSIDs per channel, it will start to go slower than 10 beacons per second; this may vary with different hardware. 

Some bug-fixes, some new features, some code clean-up. I'm keeping with the spirit of the original author, and not releasing any binaries. The project BEGS to be customised. Using the default SSID names is fine for testing, but lame for anything else. This was my first Arduino project and my first non-trivial programming in C, or whatever variant of C this is. Hopefully others will continue to build on it, and to learn from it.

New in v1.3 is improved checking of whether or not beacons are actually being sent; this is kind of important. Also a feature to periodically "rekey" the MAC addresses, and that can be done either deterministally or randomly.

<br>

ESP32 version by [@Tnze](https://github.com/Tnze): [esp32_beaconSpam](https://github.com/Tnze/esp32_beaconSpam).

I didn't publish a .bin file on purpose. This project is easy to create with Arduino and everyone should be able to get it working!  
The goal of this is to motivate people to get into hacking, electronics and Arduino, so don't be lazy and start making your own stuff! :D

## About

![network scanner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_beaconSpam/master/img/networkscanner.jpg)

This project emerged from the [ESP8266 Deauther](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther) that also has this type of attack implemented.  
But while the Deauther is very complex and might seem intimidating to an Arduino beginner, this project is simple, hackable and easy get running!  

The Arduino sketch comes with 50 default SSID names, but you can edit that list easily in the source code :).  
By constantly broadcasting the so-called beacon frames, your standard WiFi scanner will think there are active networks nearby and adds them to the list.  
In reality though, it is just advertising these network names without actually creating them. So there is no way you could connect to one of the "created" networks.  

It is using the `wifi_send_pkt_freedom` function in the ESP8266 Arduino Core SDK. This function allows packet injection for specific Wi-Fi frames.  

## Disclaimer

Even if it is more of a fun party trick than something that could actually do any harm, **please use it respectfully!**
Some people might interpret this as a "Jammer" and those are illegal. But this project is just sending a bunch of WiFi packets through the air and works within the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard.

## Installation

- First get an ESP8266 development board! If you don't know which one, have a look at the [supported devices](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/wiki/Supported-Devices) page from the Deauther wiki. It's for a different project, but the requirements are the same.
- Install [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software)
- Install the [ESP8266 Arduino Core](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager) version 2.0.0 or newer (no more changes are required)
- Download [this project](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_beaconSpam/archive/master.zip)
- Extract the .zip file somewhere and open the `esp8266_beaconSpam/esp8266_beaconSpam.ino` file with Arduino
- Edit the SSIDs if you want
- Select the correct Board under Tools > Board, the serial (COM) port your device is using and hit upload!

If you have trouble uploading, have a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/wiki/Installation#drivers-and-com-port) on the Deauther Wiki. There you will also find drivers for the most common USB-Serial chips.  
Again, this is for the Deauther and not for this project, but the hardware (ESP8266) is the same and you will find a lot of trouble-shooting info on the Wiki there! :)  

Additionally, here's a video tutorial :)
